# Microalgae Oil Conversion and By-product Processing

## Pretreatment & Cell Disruption
Microalgae undergo enzymatic treatment or mechanical disruption to break cell walls, releasing intracellular lipids and soluble organic matter. The resulting algal suspension serves as the raw material for downstream separation.

## Primary Separation
Through a phase separation unit, the mixture is divided into **crude algal oil** and **aqueous algal residue**.  
This step establishes the basis for subsequent oil refinement and by-product recovery.

## Algal Oil Refinement
Crude algal oil enters a distillation column, where it is further separated into **fuel-grade algal oil** and **non-target impurities**.  
- **Fuel-grade algal oil** can be used directly as biodiesel or as feedstock for catalytic upgrading.  
- **Impurities** are collected separately for treatment or reuse.  

## Residue and Water Treatment
- The aqueous residue undergoes **cross-flow or tubular membrane separation**, producing concentrated algal slurry.  
- The slurry is further dewatered using **plate-frame filtration**, yielding solid algal biomass suitable for use as feed, fertilizer, or fermentation substrate.  
- Membrane separation simultaneously generates **recyclable water**, part of which is returned to the cultivation pond to minimize external water demand and establish a closed-loop cycle.  

## Resource Recovery & Circular Utilization
- **Main product**: Fuel-grade algal oil (renewable energy).  
- **By-products**: Algal biomass (agricultural/industrial use), impurities (by-product management), recyclable water (returned to the pond).  

This closed-loop pathway enables both energy recovery and by-product valorization, aligning with **sustainability** and **circular economy** principles.

# Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the Algal Oil Conversion System
<img width="476" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/711ee56d-d5d2-40db-968a-3b94634eef72" />

## 1. Goal and Scope Definition
- **Goal**: To evaluate the environmental impacts of the algal oil production pathway from cultivation to fuel conversion.  
- **System boundary**: Covers pretreatment (disruption), separation, oil refinement, by-product handling, and water recycling.  
- **Functional unit**: Defined as **1 MJ of usable fuel-grade algal oil**.  

## 2. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)
Collection of energy and material flow data across all stages:  
- **Pretreatment & Disruption**: Electricity, enzyme, or chemical inputs; release of intracellular materials.  
- **Primary Separation**: Energy consumption of separation units; output flows of crude oil and aqueous residue.  
- **Oil Refinement**: Heat demand of distillation; output of fuel oil and impurities.  
- **Residue & Water Treatment**: Energy demand of membrane separation and filtration; outputs of concentrated slurry, solid biomass, and recyclable water.  
- **By-product flows**: Quantities of impurities, wastewater, and biomass; reuse ratios and disposal pathways.  

Data sources include on-site monitoring (energy, water, chemicals) and background databases (material and energy production).  

## 3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)
LCI data are converted into environmental impact indicators:  
- **Climate change**: CO₂ emissions from energy use in the fuel oil process.  
- **Resource depletion**: Enzyme, chemical, and water consumption.  
- **Ecotoxicity**: Impacts from wastewater and by-product emissions.  
- **Energy return**: EROI / EPBT, comparing input energy with recoverable energy in algal oil.  

## 4. Interpretation
- **Hotspot analysis**: Identify energy-intensive stages (e.g., disruption, distillation) and emission hotspots (e.g., wastewater, impurity management).  
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Evaluate the influence of water recycling rates and energy sources (PV vs. grid electricity).  
- **Uncertainty analysis**: Apply Monte Carlo simulations to assess variability impacts.  
- **Recommendations**: Improve disruption efficiency, increase water recovery, and utilize algal biomass as agricultural or energy resources.
